# Delay Ludum Dare (LD50)

As participants of the Ludum Dare, we are all fighting against an inevitable deadline as we only have 48h or 72h to finish our games. During the whole weekend, we see the countdowns ticking down, constantly reminding us that we might not have enough time to do everything we would like to do.

This deadline issue recently lead to the creation of a new format in LD, the [LD Extra](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/$276398/extra-the-new-casual-ludum-dare-format), which lets you until the Play+Rate deadline to make your game. However, that new format is far from a perfect solution, as while the deadline is further it is still an immuable deadline. Taking that extra 'limited' time also prevents you from taking part in the traditional Compo and Jam formats and getting ranked.

That's why we need a better solution, which is simply to **Delay Ludum Dare** itself. If we feel like there isn't enough time on the timer, we should be able to add extra time to it and allow ourselves any extra delay we might need.

Through this browser extension, you'll be able to delay the deadlines in LD as you see fit. No extra format needed. Do compo in 3 months if you want to and publish a great game with no rush needed. Take 2 years to play & rate the thousands of games done within a single LD edition as there's a lot to discover.

Live the Real Ludum Dare Extra experience.
